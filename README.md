## Team members contributions

In this team project, we initially collaborated closely on all aspects. However, during the later stages, we divided our responsibilities as follows:

- Gabriel handled ETL tasks and data preparation for the dashboard phase, while Jason reviewed his work.
- Jason concentrated on designing the Tableau dashboard, with Gabriel providing feedback on his work.
  
We split responsibilities to make the most of our strengths and get things done efficiently.

## Project objective :dart:


## Datasets

### Dataset 1: [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)

The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.



### Dataset 2: [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Person](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu)
The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.
